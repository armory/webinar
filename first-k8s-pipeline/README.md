# Building your First Kubernetes Pipeline with Spinnaker

## Objective:
Learn how to create a Spinnaker pipeline that deploys a Kubernetes manifest.

## Files Needed:
gitops/manifests/*.yml -- all the kubernetes manifests are located in this folder
The image we will be deploying is `away168/rps:v1.0.0`

Note if you're running this training material with a Minnaker instance - use the `ingress.yml` instead of the `service.yml`.
